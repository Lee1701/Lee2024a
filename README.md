The major goal of the project was to carry out virtual screening of a large-scale compound library to identify high-affinity ASGPR ligands to improve MoDEs, molecular degraders of extracellular proteins, by our pretrained AI models (EDDY). Using resources on PSC Bridges-2 Regular Memory (~100,000 CPU SUs), we have successfully completed predicting ~31.8 million binding affinities for ~51,000 small molecules from the Therma Fisher Maybridge Screening Library targeting ASGPR by our 622 sequence-based EDDY models.
